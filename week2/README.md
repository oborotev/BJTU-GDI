## 1. Game Players
You incarnate a gender ambiguous black haired child that fell into the abyss.

## 2. Game World
When you wake up you are all but lost. You don't recognized your surroundings and can't help but wander around to find out more about it.

### 2.a The abyss
It is a dark place, seemingly empty at first, but there is __something__ looming in the distance the further you engulf in the darkness.

### 2.b The glowing light
It is the only thing that is composing the scene. The player has to interact with it in order to trigger the event.

## 3. Play Goals
The goal is to beat, disregarding how it'd be done, the event triggered by the glowing light.

## 4. Prototype Picture
It would look like that :
